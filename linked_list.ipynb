    "Imagine I bring you a stack of one million papers. I tell you a few bits of information about the papers; the papers are instructions I want you to perform, the pages are in order from 1 to 1,000,000, start reading at 1, end at 1,000,000, and find a way to save your place so you can leave and come back later to continue reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would simply take the top sheet of paper from the top, read it, then set it aside. You would repeat this process until you've read the entire stack. If you need to walk away, just leave the stack of papers as it is; you simply grab the top one when it is time to start again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computing, this is a specific use case with specific needs. I need to be able to find the beginning of the stack of papers. For a physical stack of papers it's the top sheet. For a computer stack, however, we need to store the pages in a data structure that provides a few features; it needs to track the beginning and the end so we know we read the whole stack of instructions and didn't miss any pages, and when we're building the stack into memory we need to be able to add a page to the end so we can populate the data structure with our book. We also might need to add pages at the beginning in case I have something I need you to do immediately instead of waiting until the end. Lastly, we want to be able to insert pages into the book should we need to revise the list later, as well as pop values out of the list as we read them so we don't read them twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a computer builds an array, it blocks out space for the array in memory. In Python an empty list, analogous to an array, is 56 bytes in memory. Then, as you add characters, you add 8 bytes (UTF-8 encoding)."

    "Linked lists have a few unique properties. For one, once the values of our linked list are stored in memory they need not be referenced by some index or map or other method. In the same way that I instructed you only to read the top page, we only need the first item of the list and we need not know any of the other pages in the stack. As such, each page of the stack of instructions would be stored in memory, and for a singly-linked list, the page would tell you which page to read next. In a stack of physical papers, like our imaginary stack of instructions, this would be simply the next page in the stack. For a computer, we can store a tidbit of information that points us to the next page.\n",
    "\n",
    "A singly-linked list needs only a few parameters and steps to implement in this way. You create `n` number of nodes each containing a desired value and a pointer to the next node, the first item in the list is flagged as the head, and the last item as the tail. In this way, we can always immediately reference the first and last item in the list. A singly-linked list is optimized to store the least amount of information possible in order to have a list that can be navigated sequentially from the beginning, and new items can be added to or removed from the start if necessary."

    "Notice something important: popping from our linked list always takes a very small amount of time, and doesn't deviate terribly far from this amount.

Starting from the last printed value above, and going up, popping an array vs. our linked list took roughly the same amount of time until we passed the 4th order of magnitude. Then popping from the array increased by an order of magnitude alongside the input size. This is what is called linear time complexity; it scales linearly with the input size. But, the time it took to pop from the linked list took the same; this is called constant time complexity.\n",
